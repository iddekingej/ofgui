This program can be installed by running  "make install"  or it can directly run from the build folder.  Ofgui can run under a 
normal user or as a root. 

Translation:
There is only a English and a Dutch translation. 
When the program is installed with "make install" and with a prefix /usr/local, it's possible that the Dutch translation doesn't work.

This can be solved when to program is build as follows:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr ..
make 
sudo make install
